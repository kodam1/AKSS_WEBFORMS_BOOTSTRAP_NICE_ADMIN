Let's add even more functionality to your `DatabaseHelper` class to cover additional scenarios and utilities for database operations. Here’s what we can include:

1. **Async Support for Common Methods**: Extend asynchronous operations for all key methods like `ExecuteNonQueryAsync`, `ExecuteScalarAsync`, and `ExecuteDataSetAsync`.
2. **Parameter Utility Methods**: Methods to easily create and manage `SqlParameter` objects.
3. **Connection State Validation**: Helper methods to validate connection states or retry on connection failure.
4. **Query Execution with Timeout**: Allow users to set custom command timeouts.
5. **Export/Import Data**: Add methods to export query results to CSV or JSON and import data from CSV.
6. **Column Metadata Retrieval**: Fetch database table schema or column metadata.

I'll update the class to include these functionalities.

I’ve added more advanced and versatile methods to your class, such as asynchronous operations, dynamic object conversion, and more robust handling of various database scenarios. Let me know if you have specific use cases or further enhancements in mind!
